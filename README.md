# Portal
Portal mod

A combination of sofar's teleport blocks from insidethebox game, and linking books from the riventest mod. It also uses Tenplus1's slope model. 

Right click to edit portal name and destination (Leave blank to reset, or change it as often as you like). Walk over to teleport instantly. Currently, every node needs to be set individually, but I'll work on it...probably.
Removal does need a bit of work; currently the easiest way without worldedit is a node replacing tool, but the blocks can be built onto, so if you dump sand on them or something, that will also remove them.
